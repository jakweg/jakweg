After many and many failed attempts to fix it I was forced to change the basics - drop the recorder library and use <code>Xvfb</code> to simulate real display.',
						'Wojtek was initially named Andrzej, but due to Webex alphabetically sorting meeting participants I decided to rename him to Wojtek to make him less stand out at the bottom of the list.',
						'So I modified Wojtek to launch Chrome in fullscreen mode rather then in headless one and to use virtual speaker. Now I can record the screen using ffmpeg. There were numerus issues when it comes to starting pulseaudio and X11 as a root user inside docker. The easiest working solution to make it running was to kill their processes, delete <code>/run/pulse*</code> and <code>/tmp/.X1-lock</code> files and then launch the demons.',
						'After a few weeks everything seemed to work fine and reliable. Then out of nowhere Microsoft decided to release Teams update which significantly changed the UI. It obviously broke Wojtek üôÑ',
						"There was one time when recording audio failed, but visuals got recorded. What surprised me the most was very small video size. After investigating I noticed that recording audio is done in stereo mode effectively doubling audio size for no benefits at all. Thanks to this one bug I've found another one ü§ó",
						'There was also a problem which I couldn\'t detect during testing, because it appeared after about 4 minutes of recording. In short the recording got paused for some reason. After investigation I found the cause: ffmpeg, which I use to record, constantly prints some stats such as time to the console. These stats are appended to the stdout buffer available to parent process - Wojtek. However Wojtek doesn\'t care about this data therefore he never reads it. After about 4 minutes the buffer is full and the operating system suspends executing of ffmpeg until anything from the buffer is consumed. Fixing it was simple: just adding <code> stdio: "ignore" </code> to options object when launching the process ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è',

						'The number one priority for me is the easy of access for people, therefore recordings are hosted on HTTP server. That allows watching video without needing to download entire file. mp4 format is well supported in web browsers which makes it ideal candidate for this use case.',
						'But is it really? mp4 is just a container, data inside can be represented using many different codecs. Naturally I tried best codec available out there - h255, however it turns out that it is not yet natively supported on all platforms. Windows operating system even asks you to pay to open such file! In 2022 year ü§Ø',
						"That's way I decided to go with h254, which offer worse quality to size ratio, but much better compatibility.",
						'Speaking of sizes. 90 minutes of recording is‚Ä¶ about 25 MB, and you can read everything on slides. The size may increase a few MB if cameras are on during lecture, but that is not a big deal.',

						`There are two options remaining: web scraping and reverse engineering of the existing app.`,
						`At first I tried the first one - created Android WebView, simulated button clicks and parse HTML. God thanks I knew about regex at that time. I was quite successfully with reading marks data, though it worked unreliably and had quite a few limitations. Not all information were available in HTML by default. For data such as extended description I used to fetch additional HTML for each mark. That was really slow‚Ä¶ I needed a better approach‚Ä¶`,
						`Frankly there is much better way to do what. Let's check how the official app gets this data. To achieve that I used <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.greyshirts.sslcapture">Packet Capture</a> and very quickly do discover the API endpoint and what parameters to send`,
						`Screenshot of the app capturing HTTP traffic. We can see that the official app captures data that is unnecessarily and without user permission`,
						`It looks like there is only one API endpoint, returning JSON file which is a kind of database dump. I need to send login, MD5 hashed password and some additional parameters such as <em>lmt</em> which is used by the backend to determine what changes in data to send us. Entities returned by API are grouped by type and have "action" field which may be equal to "D" in which case it means this entity was deleted.`,

						`The advertisement bot's users received. It presents screenshots of early version`,
						`The first problem my app encounter when released to the wild was failing to sign users in. Yeah, failing to do the first thing they attempted was quite disappointing, but I had no chance to catch that. It was related to certain username format that some students had. It proves the necessity to test among very diverse audience, especially when having no API docs.`,
						'The app had also problems with parent accounts if there were multiple children in the same school. Very niche case, but required quite o lot of checks on my end. Thanks to the community many of such problems were quickly discovered and fixed.',

				{
					title: 'Support from the cloud - VPS',
					content: [
						`One of the problems, that I couldn't easily solve, was lack of instant (push) notifications. Mobireg doesn't provide you with a way to get notified when somethings changes. You need to ask the server - such method is called "pulling"`,
						`The alternative way is "pushing" changes to the client by the server. Waay better solution thanks to it beeing more effective with phone resources - the app doesn't need to live and ask periodically the server for changes.`,
						['Mobireg', 'server', 'periodic', 'syncing with API', 'Mobishit', 'app'],
						`The first app architecture looked very simple. Just syncing with the API endpoint. To get push notifications I had to build my architecture:`,

						`Keep in mind that using the components at the bottom is optional. User has control and can opt out of it. App can work using the first architecture, but with limited functionality. This approach is nice for more, because it allows me to quit hosting (which costs some money) at anytime and clients will fallback to using the old architecture automatically.`,
						`This way I also implemented getting exams and comparisons data as well as sending messages to teachers. Despite the official API lacking such features. I had to create my own API in Python that simulates the web browser to allow for such magic`,
					],
				},
				{
					title: 'The role of community and what I learned',
					content: [
						`There would be no Mobishit, at least in this form, if not the community. What started as a small plugin in my personal app with bus schedules transformed into huge project loved by many students.`,
						`Such achievements required <b>community</b> and therefore I now believe that whatever I code I need to talk and listen to user feedback. This is the most important factor.`,
						`I remember getting a message from one of my users asking for a new functionality: ability to change name of any subject or teacher. At first I thought it was a stupid idea, why would anyone want to do this? But since it simple to implement I did it the same day. After adding this featured I realized it was soooo awesome addition I started adding nicknames for all my teachers. My friends were also pleased by such addition. It was so much fun ü§£ - thanks to the community.`,
						`While creating this project I also appreciated <b>GIT version control system</b>. Not only I could experiment on separate branch - it also keeps my entire history. That saved me potentially hours of debugging. Once I had weird bug, only in release build, not noticeable at first, but totally breaking key feature of the app - it failed to synchronize. It worked in previous release despite me changing nothing about syncing‚Ä¶ Thanks to GIT I quickly realized that the problem was in an updated dependency that broke syncing.`,
						`The other skill I gained is <b>SQL</b>. This project utilized both SQLite and MySql. I enjoy writing raw SQL instead of using ORM queries, since writing anything more complicated results in too much hacking. Mobishit was the app I could learn a lot.`,
						'Typical SQL query I wrote. It gets existing marks to be imported into average calculator, using Room library, Kotlin',
					],
				},
				{
					title: 'What next?',
					content: [
						`After two years of studying at ZS≈Å some people started to claim that Mobireg would be replaced by Librus - competition do Mobireg. That would make Mobishit completely useless.`,
						`And it has happened. Mobireg got purchased by Librus taking all schools which used their services.`,
						`But every school? Actually no! For some reason Mobireg stayed for musical schools and they advertise it as a best grade book for musical schools. They've even changed logo to reflect that¬†üòÇ`,
						`While this move has reduced popularity of my application it haven't got rid of it completely. There still are some users. I must admit I was very surprise to receive email about GitHub Issue from one of the users. I was quick to solve the issue for him as It does my heart when someone still uses my products even though I don't support it for years¬†üòä`,
